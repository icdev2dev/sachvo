Manage  iND neurons  without Internet Identity
## TLDR; 
This repository shows how to manage the neurons created in the NNS DAPP using Internet Identity (aka iND neurons) through Seed Phase Neurons. 

## Introduction
Post genesis (circa May 2021 ) the interest in Internet Computer has led to several people buying it's native token ICP. This native token can be staked in neurons to participate in active governance of the Internet Computer. The return on the stake is dependent on the length of time that the neuron is locked up. At the time of initial creation of this document (Dec 2021), the interest on staked ICP at the maximum lock up time of 8 years is 28% APY. There are alternate methods of staking. Some are suitable for highly technical audience while others have significantly better user experience in return for loss of full control. Prior to Dec 2021, there was no support for a true hardware wallet (like Ledger). Ledger support was added to ICP in Dec 2021. So people who staked neurons between May 2021 to Dec 2021 had two options: a. Highly Technical b. Ease of Use. Most people opted for the Ease of Use option. Some fairly significant investments have been made in staking through the Ease of Use option. 

As people begun to dig deeper into the mechanics of security behind the Ease of Use option after having taken that approach, some have begun to feel buyers remorse. This has been accentuated by some reported high loss by one or two people. The broad conclusion of the engineers and researchers working on the project has been to suggest that Internet Identity is not CURRENTLY (circa Dec 2021) suitable for storing signicant store of value. The nuances of this conclusion can be found in this extensive thread on forums at https://forum.dfinity.org/t/internet-identity-lack-of-security/9144. 

This repository illustrates a way to mitigate, post facto, the risks posed by using Internet Identity to manage the neurons created through the Ease of Use option. It should be noted that other alternatives to mitigate the risks do exist. The forum topic mentioned above is the best source of information about the alternatives. Some ofthe other alternatives are less burdensome than the alternative presented here. However this alternative follows the technical path of maximum protection in the situation presented. With the advent of Ledger Integration, most people in the future will not, hopefully, forced to choose between a. Highly Technical and b. Ease of Use option. They will choose Ledger Integration with NNS Dapp (aka lND neurons over iND neurons).
